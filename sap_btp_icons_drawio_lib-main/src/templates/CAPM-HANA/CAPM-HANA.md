# Title

CAPM - HANA

## Description

Simple CAP application consuming SAP HANA Cloud service.

### When should I use it?

- When SAP HANA Cloud artifacts (tables/views/etc) are modelled in the same CAP project.
- The CAP app has direct access to the database layer, no extra configuration is required.
- The data required by the app doesn't exist in other systems (cloud or on-premise).

### Examples

- Side-by-Side extensions to keep the Core Clean.
- A marketing campaign app created to capture customer details in an event.
- An HR app created for new employees to track their onboarding progress.

### Footnotes

- HTML5 Application Repository Service can host any web app such as SAP Fiori, Angular, React, Vue, etc.
- CAPM (Cloud Application Programming Model) apps could be developed in Node.js or Java.
- Communication between the services should go through the Destination Service, not added to the diagram to simplify it.
- On-premise solutions could be both SAP and non-SAP.
- Cloud solutions could be both SAP and non-SAP.
- SAP Cloud Identity Services is not required to connect to On-premise or Cloud solutions.
