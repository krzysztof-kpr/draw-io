# Title

CAPM - On-Premise Systems

## Description

A CAP application connecting to on-premise systems.

### When should I use it?

- When neither SAP Datasphere nor SAP Integration Suite are used to manage data access to on-premise systems.
- When a CAP app needs to connect to remote on-premise APIs.

### Examples

- Side-by-Side extensions to keep the Core Clean.
- A picking/packing application using data from SAP S/4HANA.
- A Sales Order application connecting to SAP ECC systems via BAPIs.

### Footnotes

- HTML5 Application Repository Service can host any web app such as SAP Fiori, Angular, React, Vue, etc.
- CAPM (Cloud Application Programming Model) apps could be developed in Node.js or Java.
- Communication between the services should go through the Destination Service, not added to the diagram to simplify it.
- On-premise solutions could be both SAP and non-SAP.
- Cloud solutions could be both SAP and non-SAP.
- SAP Cloud Identity Services is not required to connect to On-premise or Cloud solutions.
