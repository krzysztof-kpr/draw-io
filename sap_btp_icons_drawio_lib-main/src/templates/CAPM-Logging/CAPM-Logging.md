# Title

CAPM - Logging

## Description

Simple CAP application consuming SAP HANA Cloud service.

### When should I use it?

- Application logs should always be used. There's no step-by-step debugging in native cloud applications (unlike ABAP). If an application doesn't produce logs, troubleshooting issues becomes a cumbersome task.
- Audit logs should be used to produce security event logs (who did what and when?), access to protected and privacy-related data (who? when?).

### Examples

- A finance application that produces security events logs such as created and deleted entries.
- An HR application that produces GDPR compliance logs.
- An application that produces system error logs for debugging and troubleshooting.

### Footnotes

- HTML5 Application Repository Service can host any web app such as SAP Fiori, Angular, React, Vue, etc.
- CAPM (Cloud Application Programming Model) apps could be developed in Node.js or Java.
- Communication between the services should go through the Destination Service, not added to the diagram to simplify it.
- On-premise solutions could be both SAP and non-SAP.
- Cloud solutions could be both SAP and non-SAP.
- SAP Cloud Identity Services is not required to connect to On-premise or Cloud solutions.
