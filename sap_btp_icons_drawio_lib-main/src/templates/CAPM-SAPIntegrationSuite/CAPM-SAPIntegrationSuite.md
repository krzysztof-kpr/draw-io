# Title

CAPM - SAP Integration Suite

## Description

A CAP application consuming data through SAP Integration Suite.

### When should I use it?

- When SAP Integration Suite is used to manage data access to on-premise and cloud systems, especially with SAP Business Accelerator Hub.
- When a CAP app needs to connect to remote APIs both on-premise and cloud.

### Examples

- Side-by-Side extensions to keep the Core Clean.
- An application that automatically creates ServiceNow tickets whenever a runtime issue happens.
- An application for plant maintenance using data from both SAP S/4HANA and SAP Fieldglass.

### Footnotes

- HTML5 Application Repository Service can host any web app such as SAP Fiori, Angular, React, Vue, etc.
- CAPM (Cloud Application Programming Model) apps could be developed in Node.js or Java.
- Communication between the services should go through the Destination Service, not added to the diagram to simplify it.
- On-premise solutions could be both SAP and non-SAP.
- Cloud solutions could be both SAP and non-SAP.
- SAP Cloud Identity Services is not required to connect to On-premise or Cloud solutions.
